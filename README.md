You also need the Presence Gateway Intent for the userInfos command.


## How to use

• Download [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) and [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org)

• Download the project or clone it

• Go to the LockBot folder and do `npm install`

• Run the bot by doing `node index.js`

## Potential bugs

• When the bot doesnt have settings for guilds (if no one talked yet), `say` command can crashes with a JSON parse error. In the future i'll do this part with a Database.
